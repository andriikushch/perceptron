# Perceptron

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/andriikushch/perceptron.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/andriikushch/perceptron)

A simple, generic implementation of a **Perceptron** in Go (Golang), supporting multi-dimensional datasets and optional training history recording.

## Overview

This package implements a basic **linear binary classifier** (perceptron) for numeric datasets.  
It supports:

- Training on **multi-dimensional features**.
  - 2D Example: ![animated_lines_with_errors](img/animated_lines_with_errors.gif)
  - 3D Example: ![animated_planes_with_errors](img/animated_planes_with_errors.gif)
- **Training history** tracking (optional) â€” including weights, bias, and mean error after each epoch.

## Features

- Trainable perceptron with a customizable learning rate and epochs.
- Predict new data points after training.
- Access complete **training history** for analysis or visualization.
- Lightweight and dependency-free (except for `golang.org/x/exp/constraints`).
